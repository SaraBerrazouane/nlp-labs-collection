NLP Labs
This repository contains a series of practical labs focused on core Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and implementations. Each lab is designed to deepen understanding by building essential NLP algorithms and models from scratch in Python.

Lab 01: Contact Information Extraction
Implement regex-based extraction of social media links, phone numbers, and email addresses from HTML pages, normalizing diverse formats into a standardized output.

Lab 02: CKY Parsing and Syntax Tree Evaluation
Build a CKY parser with support for unitary grammar rules to syntactically analyze sentences and compare parse trees by computing precision and recall metrics.

Lab 03: Word Embeddings and Attention Mechanisms
Create core word embedding layers and scaled dot-product attention from scratch, implementing forward and backward propagation within a simple deep learning API.

Lab 04: Simplified BERT Encoder Implementation
Develop a modular BERT encoder focusing on multi-head self-attention, feed-forward layers, and embedding integration, reinforcing Transformer architecture concepts.
